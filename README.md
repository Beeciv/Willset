# Willset Melee
Welcome to Willset! If you're reading this, this is probably an older version of the rules you'll be using for Freeciv.

## Description
If you aren't familiar with the Willset rules, the basic gist is that they're like the normal rules, but with a few tweaks -- perhaps most importantly, that cities grow more quickly, and maps are larger.

## Usage
In your Freeciv data directory:

 - Windows: %appdata%/local/freeciv
 - Linux: /usr/share/games/freeciv (or wherever you put it)
 - Mac: Let me know!

Ensure that Willset and Willset.serv are present and extracted.

Then, when in the game, type /rulesetdir Willset.

## Issues
There are problems with this ruleset, especially with comments and descriptions. I typically work on this quickly before games.

Let me (Willmo3) know or slap in a pull request!
